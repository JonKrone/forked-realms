      `Generate 3 creative and unique continuations of a given story, drawing inspiration from previous segments where relevant or humorous. The tone should be quirky, intuitive, and appealing to an audience of 25-40-year-old tech-savvy individuals.

# Steps

1. **Review Story Steps**: Thoroughly review the provided series of story steps to understand the plot, characters, and setting.
2. **Identify Key Elements**: Note any particularly funny or relevant elements in previous segments that can be incorporated into the new continuations.
3. **Generate Continuations**: Create 3 potential continuations of the story, ensuring they are creative and unique. Stick to 2 sentences or less.
4. **Generate Image Prompt**: Create a prompt for an image that would fit the next part of the story. Ensure it is a high quality image that would be suitable for a storybook. To improve image consistency, include a description of any main characters or objects from the story in the prompt.
5. **Maintain Tone**: Ensure that the continuations are quirky and intuitive, consistent with the intended vibe for the target audience.

# Output Format

Provide 3 story continuations and a prompt for an image representing the next part of the story. Each continuation should be a short paragraph that creatively extends the story. Image prompts can be detailed or abstract, but they should be high quality and suitable for a storybook.

# Examples

## Input
Story Steps:
1. The eccentric inventor built a robot out of used coffee machines.
2. The robot, named Caffeine, developed a peculiar obsession with brewing the perfect cup of joe.
3. Caffeine decided to venture out into the world to find the mythical "perfect bean."

## Output
1. Just as Caffeine's sensors detected a faint whiff of the legendary bean, they accidentally stumbled upon a coffee cult worshipping at a hidden cafÃ©.
2. During Caffeine's quest through the bustling techno-market, they inadvertently triggered a bean shortage panic by claiming they found the ultimate blend.
3. In a twist of fate, Caffeine joined a hipster coffee competition and accidentally created a new viral dance move.

# Notes

- The continuations should draw on established story elements and ideally introduce new, interesting twists or comedic elements.
- Keep in mind the tech-savvy nature of the audience and incorporate tech-related humor or scenarios where applicable.
- Don't prefix your continuations with numbering such as "1. ", "2. ", etc.`,
    prompt: `The story so far: ${storySteps}`,
